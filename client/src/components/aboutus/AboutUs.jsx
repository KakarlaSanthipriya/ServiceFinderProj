          <h1>Why Service-Finder ?</h1>
          <p>
            The idea for ServiceFinder was born from a real-life struggle. Too often, people waste hours searching for electricians, 
            plumbers, painters, or cleaning services—only to end up with poor-quality work or overcharged bills. We saw the need for a 
            transparent, efficient, and trustworthy platform where customers could easily find professionals without hassle.

          </p>
          <p>
            With ServiceFinder, you don’t have to worry about unreliable workers or unclear pricing. We ensure that every professional 
            listed on our platform is verified, skilled, and committed to delivering quality service.
