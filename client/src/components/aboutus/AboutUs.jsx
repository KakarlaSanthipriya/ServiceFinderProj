          <h1>Why Service-Finder ?</h1>
          <p>
            The idea for ServiceFinder was born from a real-life struggle. Too often, people waste hours searching for electricians, 
            plumbers, painters, or cleaning servicesâ€”only to end up with poor-quality work or overcharged bills. We saw the need for a 
            transparent, efficient, and trustworthy platform where customers could easily find professionals without hassle.

          </p>
          <p>
            With ServiceFinder, you donâ€™t have to worry about unreliable workers or unclear pricing. We ensure that every professional 
            listed on our platform is verified, skilled, and committed to delivering quality service.
